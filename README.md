# tagrefinery-gui
The Userinterface of the Tagrefinery project.

## Deployment
Clone the repository and install the npm and bower dependencies.

```bash
    npm install
    bower install
    
    grunt serve
```

You need a running [server](https://github.com/Christoph/tagrefinery-core) to use the interface. The easiest way is to download the latest [release](https://github.com/Christoph/tagrefinery-releases) and start the included server.jar file.
